# ISYE 6740 Final Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global energy usage trends and patterns using advanced data analysis techniques, including PCA and ARIMAX models. For a comprehensive description of the project's goals and methodologies, please refer to **Fall2024_Project_005**.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in **kaggle_plus_worldbank_joined_uncleaned_v4.xlsx**.  
- The data has already been prepared and cleaned for use in the provided Python scripts.  
- **Important:** Please refrain from making any additional updates to the dataset.

## Project Files
1. **Final_Project_PCA.ipynb**  
   - Conducts PCA analysis, reducing data to two dimensions to visualize energy usage similarities across countries.  

2. **FinalCodeNaturalLog.ipynb**  
   - Performs ARIMAX modeling and additional time series analysis to explore trends and patterns in energy consumption.

## Instructions
- Ensure that all required libraries are installed before running the notebooks.
- Follow the sequence of the provided files to reproduce the analysis.
